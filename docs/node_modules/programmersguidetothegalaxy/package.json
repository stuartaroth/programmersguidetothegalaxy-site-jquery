This project aims to give users a tool that will allow them to get working quickly on technology stacks that are new to them.\r\n\r\nThis project can help add to your tool belt, allowing you to easily use the best libraries and frameworks for the task at hand, regardless of your current experience and knowledge.\r\n\r\n> If all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail\r\n\r\n##### Contributing\r\n\r\nPull requests are very welcome! All new code should follow the established style.\r\n\r\nCurrently the focus should be adding new languages, across all the currently included folders/concepts.\r\n\r\nNew folders/concepts should try to include examples across all supported languages.\r\n\r\nBefore pull requesting, you should run the command ./run_all_examples.sh\r\n\r\nWhen doing this all your code should compile and run.\r\n\r\nIssues can be used to report bugs / request languages and folders.\r\n\r\nHere is the current site repo:\r\nhttps://github.com/stuartaroth/programmersguidetothegalaxy-site-jquery\r\n",
